## Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

I have a strong passion for technology and programming, which I have developed alongside my career in finance and accounting. Throughout my professional journey, I have developed several task automation programs that have streamlined processes and enhanced efficiency in every role I've held.

I am proficient in Linux, cybersecurity, Python, C, and Excel VBA, and I have experience with data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. My knowledge of C has provided me with a solid foundation for understanding new technologies and programming concepts, allowing me to adapt and learn quickly.

I look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and exploring opportunities where I can leverage my unique blend of finance expertise and technical abilities. Thank you for visiting my profile!
